## Performance Optimization Strategies

To enhance the performance of the Room Listing webapp, several optimization techniques were implemented:

### 1. Lazy Loading

Lazy loading was implemented for images and videos to ensure that media assets are only loaded when they are in the viewport. This significantly reduces initial load times and improves overall application responsiveness, especially for pages with many images or videos.

### 2. Infinite Scrolling

The application utilizes infinite scrolling to load more room listings as the user scrolls down the page. Instead of loading all the rooms at once, this approach loads a subset of rooms initially and fetches additional data as needed. This helps to minimize loading times and improve user experience.

### 3. Avoiding Unnecessary Rerenders

React's `useMemo` hook was employed to memoize expensive calculations and prevent unnecessary rerenders of components. This is particularly beneficial for components that display media (such as videos and images), ensuring that they only update when relevant data changes. By optimizing rendering behavior, the application maintains a smooth user experience even when dealing with complex state updates.

These strategies collectively contribute to a more efficient and user-friendly application, providing a seamless browsing experience for users.

## Future Enhancements

As the Room Listing Card web app evolves, plans for further enhancements include the implementation of the Context API for global state management.


### Context API Integration

With the potential growth of the application, managing state across multiple components can become challenging. The Context API provides a robust solution for sharing data globally within the app, making it easier to manage state without prop drilling.

By integrating the Context API, I aim to:

- **Simplify State Management**: Allow components to access global state directly without having to pass props down through multiple levels.
- **Enhance Performance**: Reduce the number of renders caused by prop changes, leading to smoother updates and better performance.
- **Improve Code Organization**: Centralize state management logic, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

Implementing the Context API will not only streamline our current state management but also prepare the application for future growth and complexity, ensuring a scalable architecture.
